Create a Repository
In the upper-right corner of any page, select âž•, then click New repository.

Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

Select Add README file

Under Add .gitignore select the template for your desired environment. For example "Python"

Select Create repository

Initial Project setup
Clone repo to Local environment:

git clone <link to repository>
Create and activate virtual environment:

# Linux
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv --prompt web-app

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows/Powershell
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate
Install Django

pip install Django
Create requirements file:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
Create a django project:

django-admin startproject config .
Your folder structure should now look similar to this:

EC2 Environment setup
Login to your AWS console and navigate to the EC2 service

Select "Launch instance"

Give your instance a name, for example "Web App Server"

Select Ubuntu under "Application and OS Images" Image 4

Create a new key pair and save it on your local machine

Under "Network settings" ensure that you have selected:

"Create security group"
 Allow SSH traffic

 Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet

 Allow HTTP traffic from the internet

Image 5

Alternatively you could use a security group that has these rules set already.

Configure suitable storage for your desired project.

Launch the instance

Configure inbound security rules

Once the instance is launched navigate to the security group for your newly created EC2 instance

Edit the inbound rules to allow traffic through port 8000 (for Django) and port 8080 (for Jenkins)

Install Jenkins on EC2
Connect to your EC2 instance and run the following commands to install Jenkins:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install jenkins

sudo systemctl enable jenkins

sudo systemctl start jenkins

sudo systemctl status jenkins
Configure the Jenkins Server

Navigate to http://<your-ec2-public-ip-address>:8080

Image 7

Run sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword to get the admin password and use it to Unlock Jenkins

Image 8

Select "Install suggested plugins":

Image 9

Follow the prompts to create a new admin user

Image 10

Confirm that the Jenkins URL matches the URL in your browser tab

Click on Start using Jenkins to be redirected to the Dashboard

Install Docker on EC2
Connect to your EC2 instance and run the following commands to install Jenkins:

# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update 

# Install docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io

# Install docker packages
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Enable docker service
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Start the docker service
sudo systemctl start docker

# Check if the service is running
sudo systemctl status docker

# add docker user to the same user group as root user
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Create username and password for DockerHub
docker login -u <username>

# Give permissions for docker socket file
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Repo setup for Docker
In the config/settings.py file on your local repo edit the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting to add the IP address for your EC2 instance.

Create a file named Dockerfile at the root of your local repository

Add the following code to it:

# Use Python 3.11 as the base image
FROM python:3.11

# Set the working directory within the container
WORKDIR /app/test-app

# Copy the requirements.txt file to the container
COPY requirements.txt /app/test-app

# Install dependencies using pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application to the container
COPY . /app/test-app

# Expose port 8000
EXPOSE 8000

# Apply migrations to set up the database (SQLite)
RUN python manage.py migrate

# Run the Django application
CMD ["python", "/app/test-app/manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
Read more about Dockerfiles here https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/

Push changes to remote repo

git add .

git commit -m "<Your commit message>"

git push
Test Docker on EC2
On your EC2 instance

Clone the app repository to EC2

git clone <link to your repo>
Navigate into the app directory

Build a docker container

docker build -t <desired tag name> .
Run the created Docker container

docker run -d -p 8000:8000 test-app:latest

docker ps
In your EC2 instnce add docker user to the jenkins group

sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
In the browser navigate to http://<your EC2 IP address:8000 to confirm the container ran successfully.

Create Docker Hub Personal Access Token
Sign in to your Docker account https://login.docker.com/u/login/

Select your avatar in the top-right corner and from the drop-down menu select Account settings.

In the Security section, select Personal access tokens.

Select Generate new token.

Add a description for your token. Use something that indicates the use case or purpose of the token.

Set the access permissions. The access permissions are scopes that set restrictions in your repositories. For example, for Read & Write permissions, an automation pipeline can build an image and then push it to a repository. However, it can't delete the repository.

Select Generate and then copy the token that appears on the screen and save it. You won't be able to retrieve the token once you close this prompt.

Configure Jenkins Credentials for Docker
In the Jenkins dashboard:

Select "Manage Jenkins"

Under the Security section select "Credentials"

Click on the "System" credentials

Click on "Global credentials (unrestricted)"

Click "Add credentials":

Kind: Username with password
Enter the username for your Docker account
For password enter the Personal Access Token you created earlier
Enter ID as "dockerHub"

Create Build Configuration Files
At the root of your local repository create 2 files:

Jenkinsfile
docker-compose.yml
In the Jenkinsfile add the following code:

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage("Clone Code") {
            steps {
                echo "Cloning the code"
                git url: "<your GitHub URL>", branch: "main"
            }
        }

        stage("Build") {
            steps {
                echo "Building the Docker image"
                sh "sudo docker build -t test-app ."
            }
        }

        stage("Push to Docker Hub") {
            steps {
                echo "Pushing image to Docker Hub"
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: "dockerHub", passwordVariable: "dockerHubPass", usernameVariable: "dockerHubUser")]) {
                    sh "sudo docker tag test-app ${env.dockerHubUser}/test-app:latest"
                    sh "sudo docker login -u ${env.dockerHubUser} -p ${env.dockerHubPass}"
                    sh "sudo docker push ${env.dockerHubUser}/test-app:latest"
                }
            }
        }

        stage ("Deploy") {
            steps {
                echo "Deploying the container"
                sh "sudo docker compose down && docker compose up -d"
            }
        }
    }
}
